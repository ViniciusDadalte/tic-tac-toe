# Tic Tac Toe in C

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game implemented in C. You play against the computer, which makes random moves.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using a compatible C compiler (e.g., GCC).
3. Run the compiled program.
4. You will be prompted to make a move. Enter the desired row and column, numbered from 1 to 3.
5. The computer will make its move next.
6. Continue making moves until a player wins or a tie occurs.
7. If you wish to play again, simply respond "Y" when asked if you want to play again.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile the code, you can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any other compatible C compiler. For example:

```bash
gcc main.c -o tic_tac_toe
```

To execute the compiled game, simply type:

```bash
./tic_tac_toe
